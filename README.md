# Getting Started
This framework is meant for building dynamic, single page webpages.

To get started, enter `gulp watch` into your terminal. This command will spin up a responsive dev server that refreshes upon saved changes to any of your source HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.

To create Production ready static assets, enter `gulp build` into your terminal. Your production ready assets will build into your `dist` folder.
